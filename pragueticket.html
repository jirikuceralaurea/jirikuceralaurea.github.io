        <div>These are the prices for the basic types of tickets, but there are also longer term tickets - a month or more. There are also discounts available for certain types of travellers, such as children or seniors.</div>
        <h2>Machines</h2>
        <div>All around the city, you can find machines for purchasing tickets. They can be found in nearly all metro stations and at very frequented tram and bus stops. These offer some of the basic types of tickets for purchase. Some accept cards (in metro stations there will always be at least one that does), but it's not a rule. And what's important to keep in mind is that you need to validate your ticket after buying it.</div>
        <h2>In trams</h2>
        <div>All trams currently offer the option to buy a ticket inside. There is one machine per tram where you can go and buy one of the basic types of tickets. It is possible to pay only by card.</div>
        <h2>Mobile app</h2>
        <div>A convenient way to purchase tickets is to download the mobile app called PID Lítačka. It allows you to buy all types of tickets - from basic, short-term ones to yearly ones - and use them on your phone. You can even buy a few tickets to have them ready and activate them whenever you need.</div>
        <h2>SMS tickets</h2>
        <div>It is possible to purchase short-term tickets by sending out an SMS. However, this is slightly more expensive than using the other methods.</div>
